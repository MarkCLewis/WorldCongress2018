# Data Analytics with Spark

This is the code used for my presentation on Data Analytics with Spark given at World Congress 2017.
The slides for the presentation are on [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1nw7r0ejYMKiYhmFrcqfSc-8PCqmJbNGrU3KzFN0veHQ/edit?usp=sharing).

There are three data sets used in the examples: [Adult Census Income Data](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/adult-census-income), 
[BRFSS Health Survey](https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/) and [Marvel Social Network](https://www.kaggle.com/csanhueza/the-marvel-universe-social-network).
